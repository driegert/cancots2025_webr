# Your WebR Project Setup Guide

This guide provides instructions for setting up and deploying your WebR project using GitHub Pages.

---

## Prerequisites

> [!important]
> You will need the following software installed on your computer to create your own exercise files.

- **R**: Download from <https://cran.r-project.org/>
- **RStudio**: Download from <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/>
- **Quarto**: Install from <https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/>
- **TinyTex**:
    - **Windows**: Open Command Prompt (Windows Key + R, type `cmd`, press Enter) and run:
        ```bash
        quarto uninstall tinytex
        quarto install tinytex
        ```
    - **Mac**: Open Terminal (found in Launchpad) and run:
        ```bash
        quarto uninstall tinytex
        quarto install tinytex
        ```

## Forking this Repository and Hosting Your WebR Files

> [!tip]
> This is the quickest way for you to get started with WebR exercises.

The following instructions assume that you will have a GitHub repository to contain your WebR exercises (the .qmd files) and a GitHub repository that will host the WebR exercises as HTML files.

This separates out what students would see (the hosting GitHub) and your work (the repository with the .qmd files).

### Initial Setup

1.  **Create a GitHub Account**: If you don't already have one, create a GitHub account by visiting <https://github.com/> and clicking "Sign up".
2.  **Fork the `cancots2025_webr` Repository**:
    - Navigate to the `cancots2025_webr` project repository on GitHub.
    - Click the "**Fork**" button in the top right corner of the page. This creates a copy of the repository in your personal GitHub account.  
    You will use this repository to create and modify your WebR Quarto (.qmd) files. You may want to make this repository private if you do not want to share the content with others (e.g., students).
3. **Make Your Forked Repository Private** (optional):
    - If you want to keep your exercises private, go to your repository settings, "Leave Fork Network", refresh the page, and change the "Change Repository Visibility" to private.  
    This is useful if you do not want students to see the exercises before they are ready.
4. Clone this forked repository to your computer OR download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.  
   This will create a local copy of the repository (as a directory) on your computer.
5. Create a lesson in RStudio based on the Quarto (.qmd) templates provided in the forked repository and that you want to share with students.  
This lesson .qmd file should be created in the directory that you created in 4. This directory should contain the `_extensions` folder.
4. Render the lesson to HTML. You will create a .html file and a `<your_file_name>_files/` directory.
5. Create a new directory on your computer and copy over:
    - `_extensions/` folder
    - `<your_file_name>_files/`
    - `<your_file_name>.html`
    - `CHANGEMYNAME.md`
6. Rename `CHANGEMYNAME.md` to `README.md` and ensure that you have edited the contents of this file to match your the filenames that you are using. The `README.md` file is the landing page of your `https://<your_github_username>.github.io/<your_respository_name>`  
    This allows a single link that students can use to access your exercises.
    Your directory structure should look like:
    ```
    <directory name you just created>
    ├── _extensions
    ├── <your_filename>_files
    ├── <your_filename>.html
    └── README.md
    ```
6.  **Create a New GitHub Repository**:
> [!NOTE]
> This will be the repository you will use for the course for the semester.
    - From your GitHub page: create a new, empty, **PUBLIC** repository. Give it a meaningful name (e.g., `math200-fall2025`).
    - Do **NOT** initialize it with a `README`, `.gitignore`, or license, as you will push your local files after creating the lesson (.html) files.
7. **Edit README.md**: Change the URLs in the README.md file so that they correctly point to the html files:  
```markdown
[Link Text](https://your_username.github.io/<your_repository_name>/your_file.html)
```
7.  **Push Your Project to GitHub**:  
    **OPTION 1 -- Command Line**: Open your terminal and follow the instructions provided. 
    **OPTION 2 -- GitHub Interface**: Select the "Upload files" link.
    > [!warning]
    > Directories will need to be dragged and dropped separately from individual files!
8.  **Enable GitHub Pages**:
    - Go to your newly created repository on GitHub.
    - Click on "**Settings**" (usually found near "Insights").
    - In the left-hand menu, click on "**Pages**".
    - Under "Source", ensure "**Deploy from a branch**" is selected.
    - Under "Branch", select `main` (or `master` if your default branch is named `master`) and click "**Save**".  
    GitHub Pages will then build and deploy your WebR HTML file. This process may take a few minutes. Once deployed, a link to your live site will appear on the same "Pages" settings page.

# Limitations

Any work that is done in a WebR document is not retained after the webpage is closed, refreshed, etc.

The webpage can be printed to retain the information.

The packages that are directly supported are listed and searchable at [https://repo.r-wasm.org/](https://repo.r-wasm.org/).  
These can be installed by placing the package names in the YAML of the `.qmd` file and/or can be made available using `install.packages()` as per usual.

A minimal example of making the `tibble` and `ggplot2` packages available once the WebR exercise is loaded by the student would be:

```yaml
format: html
filters:
  - webr
webr:
  packages: ["tibble", "ggplot2"]
```
